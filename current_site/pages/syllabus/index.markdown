## Books ##

There is no textbook for this class (it would be obsolete by the time it was printed anyway), but we will be reading from several sources throughout the term.  These readings will be distributed electronically and/or on paper.


## Professionalism Points ##

Roughly 1/3 of your grade (equivalent to a GRASP) will be based on your *professionalism* in class.  At the beginning of the term, you will start with full points.  Points will be deducted based on behaviors.


## Late Work ##
Late assignments will be accepted one day late for reduced credit.  After that, they will no longer be accepted.  I've found that this policy makes class better for everyone.

## General Classroom Rules ##

1.  Clean up after yourself
2.  Respect the space
3.  You break it, you buy it
4.  Use appropriate language and volume
