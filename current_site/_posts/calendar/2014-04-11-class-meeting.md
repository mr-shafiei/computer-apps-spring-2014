## Agenda ##

It's been a long 2 weeks of testing!  We've also been upgrading the lab.  Because of this, there is a good chance that many of you might need to get caught up or just take a break.

So, we will not start anything new today!

BUT, by the end of class today, you should have the following things finished:

1.  Email 1 revised
2.  Vocabulary Packet 1 finished
3.  DropBox portfolio created and shared
4.  Binder labeled and used
5.  "What is a computer?" project finished
