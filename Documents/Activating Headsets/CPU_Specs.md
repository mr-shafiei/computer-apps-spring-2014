# CPU Specs Explained #

## Brand ##

There are 2 major companies that make processors, **Intel** and **AMD**.

For phones and some tablets, **Samsung** makes chips that go into Android and iPhones


## Product Line (Name) ##

The product line is a group of products aimed towards a similar purpose. For example: Xeon and Opteron processors are designed for servers while Core i5 Mobile processors are designed for mobile devices such as laptops. 

Some common lines (names) at the moment are:

- Core i3
- Core i5
- Core i7
- A5
- A6
- Xeon
- Opteron
- FX



## Code Name ##

The code name of a CPU is what further divides a product line. When a new advancement is made to the basic architecture of a CPU line, it is given a new code name. If the changes are large enough (such as a new socket design), a new product line is generally launched as well. Before a product is released, it is often referred to according to it's code name such as Sandy Bridge or Llano.

## Socket ##


The CPU socket is the physical connection between the CPU and the motherboard. 

The socket types must match on the motherboard and the CPU or they won't connect with each other.


## Number of Cores ##

Originally, CPUs were manufactured with a only core that did all of the work. 

As computers became more advanced, it was found that a single core could no longer handle the all of the work.

The solution was simple: add more cores! Each core is basically a whole new processor on the same chip, so by adding a second core the power of the CPU was essentially doubled. 

Dual-core (2 cores) processors are common today, but you can also find quad-core (4 cores), hex-cores (6 cores) and octo-core (8 cores).



## Clock Speed ##

The clock speed (commonly referred to as the frequency) of a CPU is how many instructions per second it can process and is typically reported in MHz or GHz. For example, a 3GHz (or 3000MHz) processor can complete 3,000,000,000 instructions per second. 

For example, your job requires 1,000,000,000 instructions. A 3GHz processor can complete this in roughly a third of a second, while a 1GHz CPU will take a full second to complete.

Due to variances in CPU architecture, two processors with the same clock speed will not necessarily perform the same job in the same amount of time. This is why AMD and Intel processors do not always perform the same even if the number of cores and clock speed are identical. Depending on the architecture, either one CPU or the other will have an advantage due to how efficiently the CPU can process all of the instructions. This is also evident when looking at newer versus older generations of CPUs. The Intel Core i7 Extreme QUAD CORE 965 3.2GHz is much faster than the Intel Core 2 Extreme QUAD CORE QX9775 3.2GHz even though it has the same clock speed and number of cores due to advancements found in the newer CPU's architecture.

With all other things being equal - number of cores, cache size, architecture, etc - a higher clock speed will always be able to complete a set of instructions faster than a lower clock speed.
