## Overview ##

As a CTE (Career and Technical Education) teacher, one of my goals is to ensure that you develop and exhibit the qualities necessary for success in the workplace.

These qualities include:

- Punctuality and reliability
- Appropriate use of time
- Care for equipment and environment
- Appropriate behavior
- Adherence to school and classroom rules

I believe that **all** of you are capable of exhibiting these qualities, but sometimes need some motivation.  As such, a GRASP grade will be dedicated to your professionalism.

| GRASP       |                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Goal        | Demonstrate professional behavior            |
| Role        | You will one day have a job                  |
| Audience    | ME and your classmates (Coworkers)           |
| Situation   | Imagine that our classroom is your workplace |
| Product     | Your behavior + Written Reflection           |

## Steps to Completion ##

There is very little you need to do except exhibit the qualities above and correct your behavior based upon feedback.




## Grading ##

**You must receive a "C" or better on this assignment in order to pass this class**

I will consider your professionalism and assign a grade based upon my grading guidelines.

I will provide you with a grade and feedback at least 4 times (see grading calendar).

Your final grade for this project will be the highest grade you have earned, except in cases where the last grade is significantly lower than your previous grades.  In that case, your lowest grade will be your final grade.


### Example 1 ###

    1st Grade:    C
    2nd Grade:    B+
    3rd Grade:    A-
    4th Grade:    A-
    
    Final Grade:  A-
    
    (This example shows a student who is making improvements)
    
### Example 2 ###

    1st Grade:    A
    2nd Grade:    A
    3rd Grade:    B
    4th Grade:    C
    
    Final Grade:  C
    
    (This example shows a student whose professionalism is declining)
    

## Automatic Failure ##

You will automatically fail this GRASP (and the class) for any truly egregious behaviors including, but not limited to:

- Damage or theft of any equipment
- Excessive unexcused absences
- Repeatedly stuffing trash or gum into the furniture
