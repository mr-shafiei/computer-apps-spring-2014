# Professional Email #2 #

## Instructions ##

I would like for you to write a short review of an app or product, mimicking the template below.  

I have <kbd>highlighted</kbd> key structural words you should likely keep.


## The Template ##
<div class="panel">
<kbd>The good:</kbd> Netflix for iOS gives you great-looking streaming movies and shows. Controls are smooth and performance is reliable.
The bad: The streaming library is only a fraction of the larger DVD library. You still can't add to or change your DVD queue via the app.
The bottom line: If you don't mind the limited streaming library, Netflix offers great picture quality, smooth controls, and reliable performance.
