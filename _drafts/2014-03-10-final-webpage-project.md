## Steps to Completion ##

### Step 1:  Identify the Purpose of your Website ###

For most practical web design, form follows function.  In other words, your site's design reflects what it is used for.

Please answer the following questions (in an email to <span class="label">chec.shafiei@gmail.com</span>):

#### Content ####
1.  What content will be needed for the site?
2.  List the sections and features that will be included
3. What already exists and what needs to be developed?


#### Communication ####
1.  What should the site communicate?
2.  What are the primary objectives and goals for the site?

### Step 2:  Create a blueprint

A blueprint is a sketch of how your site is going to look, but more importantly, it contains some functional information (such as where pictures or video would go and how pages link together).
