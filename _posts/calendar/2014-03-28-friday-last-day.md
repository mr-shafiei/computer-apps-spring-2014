Dear Classes,

Thank you for a wonderful term.  As a whole, you have been the most well-behaved classes I have had so far at CHEC.  Each of you has also created something that you likely did not know how to do several weeks ago.

Please check your email over the next few days where I will be sending you some comments.  Your final grades will be posted on Engrade by Monday.

I will be accepting project revisions until Friday, April 4.

Good luck and always feel free to contact me!

-Mr. S


# Agenda #

You should be working on your project today.  Additionally, you should make sure your Dropbox folder is in order.  If you did not present your project, you will need to do that today, or else I will be tracking you down next week.

# Finally, I would greatly appreciate if we all tidied up the room briefly! #
