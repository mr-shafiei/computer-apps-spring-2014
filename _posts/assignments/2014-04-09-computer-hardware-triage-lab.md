## Purpose ##

Computer systems can be incredibly complex and when errors occur, there can be a number of solutions.

The first step in learning how to repair these systems is to do some simple sorting and triaging; we will do a systematic check

Through this project, our hope is that you get some exposure to computer hardware along with the process involved in building and maintaining a large IT infrastructure.

## Future Jobs ##

IT Systems Analysts can earn big bucks:  The median salary is near $90,000.

Many people begin learning these systems through hands-on training and "apprenticeship" style jobs.

## Goal ##

By the end of this project, you should be able to diagnose and describe computer hardware problems using diagnostic tools (such as checklists).

## Instructions ##

Under the supervision of Mr. Shafiei and Mr. Tobias, we will be testing various pieces of equipment.

There will be a checklist for you to complete for each piece of hardware and this should be attached to the hardware.


## Grading ##

This will be based on your participation:

    A - Outstanding participation
    B - Good Participation
    C - Acceptable Participation
    D - Needs Improvement
    F - Did Not Participate
    


## Documents ##

These will be distributed on paper
