---

## Steps to Completion ##

### Step 1:  Conduct Research and Choose a Computer ###

You will be assigned a scenario which contains a budget and specifications for your computer system.

While there are no restrictions for what brands or stores you may use, here are some suggestions:

http://amazon.com
http://apple.com
http://dell.com
http://bestbuy.com
http://newegg.com


### Step 1A:  Compare and Contrast ###

Work with the other people assigned to your scenario.  Think about the following question:

What technical trade-offs did you have to make in order to afford your computer?

*or*

What technical features would you have not been able to afford with a lower budget?


### Step 2:  Prepare Your Report ###

Once you have chosen your computer, prepare a brief report about that computer.  Your report should include the following:

1.  A List of items to be purchased and their prices
2.  An explanation about how your chosen computer fits the scenario.  Use technical vocabulary and numbers
3.  An explanation of the computers pros and cons
4.  An answer to the question in Step 1A above
5.  A picture of the computer.


You may prepare your report using whatever tool you wish.




### Step 3:  Submit ###

You should submit this on DropBox.  If you are doing it by hand, then please scan or photograph your work and then upload the picture to DropBox.

### Step 4:  Revise (if necessary) ###
