# Website Project 1 #

## Purpose ##

Every website you visit is ultimately composed of HTML code.  Understanding the structure behind this language will allow you to not only create your own websites, but make better use of web-building tools.


## Goals ##

*  By the end of this project, you will have built a functioning webpage that is available for the world to see.
* Additionally, you will have demonstrated the ability to use a code editor program (Cloud 9)


## Instructions ##

        <body>
        
        ~~[Your Webpage Content Goes Here]~~
